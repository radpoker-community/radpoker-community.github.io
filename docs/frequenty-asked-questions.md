## :point_right: Can I pay for the Monthly Subscription using Prize Money?

No. Not at the moment.

## :point_right: Can I choose my opponent or the player I want to play with?

No. Game queue is random.

## :point_right: I want to play with a High Ranking player. How can I setup a game with them?

Speak to the player you want to play with in Live Chat. Once you both agree to have a game, join the Queue. There is no guranttee that you will end up playing with each other as previosly mentioned that game queue is random.

## :point_right: How do I know who is in the Game Queue?

You cannot see who is in the Game Queue. However, when a player is in the game queue, the play box will turn green. You cannot see who is in the queue but you will see that someone is in the queue. Notice the subtle difference between the Monthly Contest Play Box and Daily Contest Play Box. As you can see, Monthly Contest Play Box is lit green, it means someone is in the Game Queue for Montly Contest and Daily Contest Play Box is not lit green which means noone is in the Game Queue for Daily Contest
