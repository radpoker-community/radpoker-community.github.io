## Resets
If you lose one or two games, your chances to make it into the money are very slim. However, you can *reset*. When you purchase resets and use them for the contest, your score will be 1500 and your win/loss will becomes 0/0. Basically, when you apply a reset, it's like you are starting over.

## Scoring System

The points gained or lost in a game definitely depend on your opponent's score and your past performance, but it's not just based on the number of games played overall. There are often more detailed factors involved in point calculations. Here's a breakdown of what we have observed:

### Specific examples

:point_right: Beating a high-ranked opponent: You'll likely gain significant points, especially if you had a lower score initially. Your recent performance and the skill rating system also play a role.

:point_right: Losing to a high-ranked opponent: You might lose fewer points compared to losing to someone closer to your level. Again, your performance and skill rating influence the exact point deduction.

:point_right: Beating a low-ranked opponent: You'll probably gain fewer points than you would for defeating a higher-ranked player. Your win streak and skill rating might come into play here as well.

:point_right: Losing to a low-ranked opponent: This could result in a significant point loss, especially if you were on a winning streak or have a higher skill rating than your opponent.


## General Strategy
:point_right: Play your full quota of games and leave it all out on the virtual felt.

:point_right: Go head-to-head with rivals of similar rank, or test your mettle against higher-scoring players.
